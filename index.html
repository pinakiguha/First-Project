    <h1>Traditional clothes of India</h1>

    <p><b>F</b>ashion in India is as ancient as human civilization. It has been interwoven with Indian’s rich culture, history and different regions. What we are seeing now is a collection of decades of knowledge passed on from generation to generation of different
        fashion trends that have evolved. In ancient India, clothes were mainly made from locally grown cotton during the Indus Valley Civilization. People from the rich and affluent communities wore clothes -like the sari worn by women- made from imported
        silk, while the rest wore clothes made from local fabrics. Women wore knee-length skirts with bangles, necklaces, earrings anklets, rings etc . made from silver, copper, gold and stones like turquoise, quartz etc. The men draped on turbans on
        their heads while Kings and priest put on robes. Men also loved to adorn themselves with jewellery just like their women.</p>

    <p><b>C</b>lothing in India is dependent upon the different ethnicity, geography, climate, and cultural traditions of the people of each region of India. Historically, male and female clothing has evolved from simple garments like kaupina, langota, achkan,
        lungi, sari, gamcha, and loincloths to cover the body into elaborate costumes not only used in daily wear, but also on festive occasions, as well as rituals and dance performances. In urban areas, western clothing is common and uniformly worn
        by people of all social levels. India also has a great diversity[1] in terms of weaves, fibers, colours, and material of clothing. Sometimes, color codes are followed in clothing based on the religion and ritual concerned. The clothing in India
        also encompasses the wide variety of Indian embroidery, prints, handwork, embellishment, styles of wearing clothes. A wide mix of Indian traditional clothing and western styles can be seen in India.</p>

            with the help of a belt, ornamental and embroidered or a flat and simple one, around the waist. Owing to its widespread popularity throughout India, different languages have different terms to describe dhotis. In Marathi, it is called dhotar.
            In Punjabi, it is known as a chadra. In Gujarati it's known as "Dhotiyu ", while in Telugu they are called Pancha. In Tamil, they are called veyti, and in Kannada it is called Panche/Lungi. Over the dhoti, men wear shirts or kurtas.</p>

    <p>A Lungi, also known as sarong, is another traditional garment of India. A Mundu is a lungi, except that it is always white.[47] It is either tucked in, over the waist, up to knee-length, or is allowed to lie over and reach up to the ankle. It is usually
        tucked in when the person is working, in fields or workshops, and left open usually as a mark of respect, in worship places, or when the person is around dignitaries. Lungis, generally, are of two types: the open lungi and the stitched lungi.
        The open lungi is a plain sheet of cotton or silk, whereas the stitched one has both of its open ends stitched together to form a tube-like structure. Though mostly worn by men, elderly women also prefer lungi to other garments owing to its good
        aeration.[48] It is most popular in south India, though people of Bangladesh, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and Somalia also can be seen in lungis, because of the heat and humidity, which create an unpleasant climate for trousers, though
        trousers have now become common outside the house
